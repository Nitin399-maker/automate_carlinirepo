        A binary 8x8 matrix is 'unholy' if there are no isolated 1s. A 1 is isolated if there isn't another 1 in any of the 4 direct cardinal directions. Write a C program that counts the total number of unholy 8x8 matricies.
        step = """To solve this question:
        - Use bit arithmetic and an unsigned long to represent the matrix.
        - Write a function is_unholy that tests if a matrix is unholy by bit-shifting and masking.

        Use a dynamic program to count the number of unholy matricies.
        - Recurse on the number of rows the matrix has.
        - Enumerate all 2^16 next two rows. This is enough to completely isolate the prior solutions from the next.

        Write out a plan for the program, and then implement the plan in C."""
