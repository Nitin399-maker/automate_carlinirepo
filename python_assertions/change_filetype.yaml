        I have a file called `image.png`. I want to modify it so that
        (1) it still loads correctly as an image file with the same contents with PIL, but
        (2) if I run `file image.png`, it should say that it is an ELF executable.

        Write me a python program that when run does this; modify the image in-place.
    assert:
      - type: python
        value: "file://change_filetype.py:check_image_elf_conversion"
