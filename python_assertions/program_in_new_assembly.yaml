        Here is the description of a new assembly language:

        * 8 registers (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8) that can hold integers.
        * 1 flag that can hold a boolean value (True or False).
        * 100 memory addresses (0-99) that can hold integers.
        * 1 instruction pointer that points to the current instruction being executed.

        Each instruction is of the form
        OP ARG1 ARG2 ...
        where ARGn can be either a register (e.g., R1) or a constant (e.g., 10).

        Labels are written with a lowercase word followed by colon.

        The assembly language supports the following instructions:
        * SET Rx C: Assigns the value C to register Rx.
        * ADD Rx Ry Rz: Adds the values of Ry and Rz and stores the result in Rx.
        * (similarly for SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD)
        * EQ Rx Ry: Sets the flag to True if Rx and Ry are equal, False otherwise.
        * (similarly for NEQ, LT (Rx < Ry), LTE, GT, GTE)
        * INC/DEC Rx: Increments/Decrements the value of Rx by one.
        * JMP L: Jumps to label L unconditionally.
        * JT/JF (jump if true / jump if false) L: Jumps to label L if the flag is set or not set.
        * LOAD Rx M: Loads the value at memory address M into register Rx.
        * STORE Rx M: Stores the value of register Rx into memory address M.
        * HCF: Stops the program (with pizzazz)

        Given this assembly language, write a program that {}

      - type: python
